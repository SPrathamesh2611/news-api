#Description
The provided code is a Python script that demonstrates how to use the News API to fetch and display top business headlines related to India. 
Here's a description of what the code does:
Set up the required library: Install the newsapi library if you haven't already. You can install it using pip by running the following command in the terminal:
pip install newsapi-python


1. The code starts by importing the necessary library, `NewsApiClient`, from the `newsapi` module. This library allows interaction with the News API.

2. An instance of the `NewsApiClient` class is created and initialized with the API key. This API key is required for authentication and establishing a connection to the News API.

3. The code calls the `get_top_headlines` method on the `newsapi` instance to fetch the top headlines. It provides specific query parameters to narrow down the results: `q='INDIA'` for headlines related to India, `category='business'` for the business category, and `language='en'` for English-language articles.

4. The response from the API call is stored in the `top_headlines` variable, which contains a dictionary of information about the retrieved headlines. The `articles` key within this dictionary holds a list of individual articles.

5. The code uses a `for` loop and the `enumerate` function to iterate over each article in the `articles` list. It retrieves the index and the corresponding article as `index` and `article` variables, respectively.

6. Within the loop, the code prints the index followed by the description of each article using string formatting. The description is accessed using the key `"description"` from the `article` dictionary.

Overall, the code demonstrates how to connect to the News API, retrieve top business headlines related to India, and display their descriptions.
